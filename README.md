# Philosophers Chatbot
*A project by [Almir Paulo](https://github.com/AlmirPaulo)*.

A Chatbot Web Application built in Django that try to emulate the Philosopher [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius). Now you can have a nice talk with the most wise roman emperor about philosophy and stoicism. 

## How it works?

Access the live demo, then in the main page type something in the input and click the button to send. Just as in any other online form.

In a few seconds Marcus Aurelius will answer you! Simple as that!

## F.A.Q.

### 1. Who is this Alfred you mention in the repo?

It's a Machine Learning (ML for short) project called [Alfred](https://github.com/ianramzy/ai-chatbot) by [Ian Ramzy](https://github.com/ianramzy).

Alfred is an AI chatbot, that learns based on a simple text file. For this project I am using [Marcus Aurelius *Meditations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations) to train Alfred (now Marcus Aurelius...) on how to behave. 

The Alfred's code remains almost the same, with little changes to adapt to the this application. 

### 2. Why it takes so long to Marcus Aurelius answer me?

It's the time the AI takes to process the answer. Philosophers, you know... Even simple questions sounds incredibly deep for them!

### 3. Why it say it doesn't understand me?

The AI is trained with the book Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. So it's limited to this content. The AI is not perfect and may not understand you. 


## Ideas for Improvement

In what concerns the backend, the main idea for scalability is to create a database (NoSQL maybe) with more content to train the AI. So we can have a "better Marcus Aurelius" or more Philosophers (adding their respective books). Feel free to pull request me any improvement in this  areas.
